//TO DO:
//Let player know when enemies are Dead
//

//Classes
//Create monsters
//Win or lose loop
//Attack one monster loop
//Attack type matters
//Monsters do different damage and have different hitpoints
//Feedback is completeand concise.  (Good "Minotaur hits for 14!  You have 12 hitpoints remaining."  Bad "With a mighty roar that shakes the earth and a B+ in creative writing class, the beast swings with the force to bring down a tree.  You barely block it with your shield that you bought in town last week from a very nice merchant named Eisenfricalheimer who was missing a finger on his left hand and whose daughter attended the same fighter college as your cousin Ed but was a year higher than him so they didn't really talk much and take 14 damage.")
